      "4. **Data Warehousing Solutions**: Familiarize yourself with data warehousing solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake. üè¨\n",

They design, construct, install, test, and maintain highly scalable data management systems. They ensure that data is clean, available, and distributed efficiently for use in various applications. Their tools are often programming languages like Java, SQL, and Python, as well as systems like Hadoop and Spark.\n",

      "2. Data Scientist üë©‚Äçüî¨: \n",
      "   Data scientists, on the other hand, are more like detectives. They use the infrastructure built by data engineers to analyze, interpret, and derive insights from data. They apply statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning techniques to business questions, and communicate their findings to stakeholders. They often use tools like Python, R, SAS, and Tableau.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, a Data Engineer builds the \"road\" (data infrastructure) and the Data Scientist drives on it (analyzes the data) to reach the destination (business insights).
